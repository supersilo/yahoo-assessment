Solution Summary
Service/Component Selection:
The solution utilizes various AWS services and components for different purposes:

AWS Lambda: Deployed two Lambda functions (get_object and timestamp_uploader_lambda) written in Python 3.9 to interact with S3 buckets, perform encryption/decryption (KMS), and handle periodic tasks (CloudWatch Events). Serverless is the best solution here because the application is small and the run-time is pretty fast. deploying this on EC2 or ECS might be an overkill, we dont need a VM running all the time for this.

S3 Bucket: Created two buckets, one as the source (timestamp_bucket) and another as the destination (replication_bucket) for replication purposes. Bucket versioning and lifecycle configurations are set to optimize storage costs.

IAM Role & Policies: Defined IAM roles (lambda_exec_role, replication_role) and associated policies (lambda_s3_policy, replication) for Lambda execution and bucket replication, ensuring necessary permissions.
CloudWatch Events & Lambda Triggers: Configured CloudWatch Event rules to trigger Lambda functions periodically.
API Gateway: Created an API Gateway (lambda) to invoke Lambda functions via HTTP requests, facilitating access to specific functionalities.

Scalability and Cost:
As traffic increases, the cost may scale primarily due to increased Lambda invocations and potential data transfer costs between regions for bucket replication.
Utilizing lifecycle policies helps in cost optimization by transitioning object storage classes based on their lifecycle.
Monitoring Availability and Performance:

CloudWatch Logs: Logging configurations (aws_cloudwatch_log_group) capture logs for API Gateway requests, Lambda function invocations, and error traces for monitoring.

CloudWatch Metrics: Can set up additional CloudWatch Alarms and Metrics to track Lambda and API Gateway performance.

Regional Disaster Recovery:
In case of a regional disaster the replication configuration (aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration) ensures continuous data replication from the source to the destination bucket.
The disaster impact to end-users is minimized as data remains available in the replicated bucket in a different region.

Compliance with Best Practices:
Adheres to AWS IAM best practices by providing least privilege permissions through IAM roles and policies.
Utilizes encryption (KMS) and versioning (S3) for enhanced security and data protection.
Implements lifecycle policies for cost-effective storage management.
Utilizes CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, adhering to best practices for observability.
